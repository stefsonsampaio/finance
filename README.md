Open Finance Simulator from cs50 course

Harvard introductory computer science course activity usiing Flask, Python, HTML, CSS and SQL

This activity simulates an application for buying and selling real shares on the stock exchange, using an API that has access to the current value of shares such as NuBank, Apple, among others.

To use Flask, you need to have this schema tree, with the application.py file and a folder called "templates" with HTML and CSS files. The others are there to leave the program as it is, to complete the course activity.

The database is used to store the user's login information and balance after buying and selling shares. At cs50's IDE, I've using SQLite3, because it was the only version supported by the IDE.

At static folder, we have images used in case of any code or login error. Specific activity request was also requested.
